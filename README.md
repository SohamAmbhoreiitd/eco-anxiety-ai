Of course. Here is a complete README.md file for your project. You can copy and paste this text directly into a new file named README.md in the root of your eco-anxiety-ai backend folder.

Eco-Anxiety AI Counselor üåø
This project is a full-stack AI chatbot application designed to provide empathetic, action-oriented, and psychologically-informed support for users experiencing eco-anxiety. It leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture to provide safe and contextually relevant responses from a curated knowledge base.

Core Features ‚ú®
Empathetic AI Chat: A conversational interface powered by a large language model (LLM) instructed to be supportive and kind.

RAG Architecture: The AI's responses are strictly based on a custom knowledge base, preventing confabulation and ensuring the advice is safe and relevant.

Critical Safety Layer: A triage system that detects keywords related to severe distress and provides immediate emergency contact information instead of an AI response.

Simple Web Interface: A clean, responsive chat interface built with React for user interaction.

Tech Stack & Architecture ‚öôÔ∏è
This project is built with a modern Python backend and a React frontend.

Backend:

Framework: FastAPI

AI Orchestration: LangChain

LLM: Configured to work with Groq (Llama 3), OpenAI (GPT-3.5+), or Google (Gemini).

Embeddings: sentence-transformers (via Hugging Face)

Vector Database: ChromaDB

Frontend:

Framework: React.js

Styling: Plain CSS

Setup and Installation üöÄ
To get this project running locally, you'll need to set up the backend and the frontend separately.

Prerequisites
Python (3.9+) and pip

Node.js (v18+) and npm

Backend Setup
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd eco-anxiety-ai
Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

On macOS/Linux:

Bash

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
On Windows:

Bash

python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
Install Python dependencies:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up your API Key:

Create a file named .env in the root of the eco-anxiety-ai folder.

Add your chosen LLM API key. For example, for Groq:

GROQ_API_KEY="gsk_YourSecretGroqKeyGoesHere"
Build the Vector Database:

The first time you set up the project, you need to process the files in the knowledge_base folder.

Temporarily modify app/core.py to run the create_vector_db() function (as we did in development).

Run the script:

Bash

python app/core.py
A chroma_db folder will be created. You can now revert your changes to app/core.py.

Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend project folder:

Bash

cd ../frontend 
(Assuming it's in a sibling directory)

Install Node.js dependencies:

Bash

npm install
How to Run the Application ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
You need to have two terminal windows open simultaneously.

Run the Backend Server:

In the eco-anxiety-ai directory:

Bash

uvicorn app.main:app --reload
The backend will be running on http://localhost:8000.

Run the Frontend Application:

In the frontend directory:

Bash

npm start
The frontend will automatically open in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

You can now interact with the chatbot!

Project Roadmap üó∫Ô∏è
This MVP is the foundation for a more robust application. Future development phases include:

Phase 4: Analytics & Deployment

Integrate a production-grade database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for anonymized analytics.

Deploy the backend and frontend to a cloud provider (e.g., Render, Vercel).

Implement a formal feedback mechanism for users.

Phase 5: Advanced Features & Personalization

Develop a Personalized Recommendation Engine to suggest resources.

Create Structured Journeys like a "Mood to Action" planner.

Implement user accounts for saving progress.

Fine-tune an open-source model on collected data to create a specialized expert on eco-anxiety.
